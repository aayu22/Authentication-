Extensions are small software programs that customize the
browsing experience. They enable users to tailor Chrome
functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences.
This Chrome Extension project is a single click solution for
students to manage any educational queries. The extension
includes multiple components and a range of functionality,
which is narrowly defined and easy to understand.
